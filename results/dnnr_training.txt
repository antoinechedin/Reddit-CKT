# Graph Details

A simple Deep neural network was performed in order to find a any pattern in the dataset.
This graph represents the gradient descent training curve of the regressor. This regressor was trained
on the reddit dataset. The script that created this graph can be found in `src/main/python/keras.py`

About the hyper parameter:
The dataset was split into to set, one for training, another for validation. The split was random and
the validation size was 20% of the original dataset size. The regressor was trained over 5,000 epochs
with a full batch, that's mean we trained over the full dataset 5,000 times. The neural network was
composed of 5 layer of 32 nodes fully connected, with RELU activation. The learning rate was 0.001

X: epoch
Y: Mean absolute error

# What we can see

Let's forget about the validation curve (orange one) and concentrate on the training.
This graph show clearly that *there's no strong pattern in the data*. With a full batch train, and
5 layers of 32 nodes, the training phase should have over fit the data. But that's not the case,
we can clearly see that the loss get stuck at 14.9 after 500 epochs and don't improve in any way after.
If there were any kind of relation between th features and the target, the NN should have find it, and
even try to over fit it.

A simple precision, a 15 mean absolute error is what a simple linear regressor find. That confirm that
there's no pattern to found better than a linear regression with this kind of features.
